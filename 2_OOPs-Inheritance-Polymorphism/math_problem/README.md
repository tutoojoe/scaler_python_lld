# Math Class
## Problem Statement
You are tasked with creating a Python class for mathematical operations related to circles. The class should encapsulate the functionality required for computing the area of a circle.

### Requirements
The Math class should have the following:

* PI: denoting the value of PI(3.14)
* getCircleArea(radius): This method should take the radius of a circle as a parameter and return the area of the circle.

### Instructions
Implement the `getCircleArea` function in the Math class.
The `getCircleArea` method should properly calculate the area of a circle using the provided radius and the value of PI (Math.PI).
